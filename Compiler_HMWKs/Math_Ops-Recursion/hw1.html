<h3>CMPSC 122<br>
Fall 2014</h3>

<h3>Homework I<br>
5 September 2014</h3>
</center>

This assignment exercises the programming skills developed in CMPSC 121.
One small portion will be manipulating an array of characters;
the larger portion will require mutually recursive functions.
<p>
Some of the interfaces are defined in this assignment already
(and must be followed); others will need to be designed and implemented.
<p>
<h4>PROBLEM DESCRIPTION</h4>
<p>
Most people would have a similar interpretation of the following expression:
<pre><font size=+1>
	9 - 6 * ( 2 + 8 / 4 ) - 1 + 3 * 7 % 5
</font></pre>
The parentheses enforce an explicit order of operations (the contents
must be evaluated before its value can be used).  The other operators
are also assumed to have a precedence:  the multiplication and division
operators occur before addition and subtraction, and operators in
the same category are evaluated from left to right.
<p>
The purpose of this assignment is to develop a program that
will evaluate expressions such as this, with the same results.
Later in the semester, this course will introduce various data
structures to help this problem, but for now, recursive functions
will be applied, since each function call has its own memory
to record what it needs to know.
<p>
<h4>COMPONENT FILES</h4>
Header Files (.h) provide declarations to be used by other parts
of a large project.  Generally these header files also have
Source files (.cpp) that provide the implementation for
functions whose prototypes appear in the header file.
<p>
After this assignment, header files will also declare classes,
to allow for calling the methods within those classes.  This
assignment, however, simply includes function declarations.
<p>
This assignment divides the problem into two distinct parts --
a scanning part (<tt>tokenize</tt>) to understand the character
text of the expression and break it up into individual values
and operators (i.e. tokens); and an evaluation part that will
understand how all the tokens combine to compute a value.
<p>
Later assignments will improve upon one part or the other;
the division is begun here to avoid having to divide later.

A very different version of this file will be used for grading.
</table>
<p>
The files to be submitted for this assignment are <tt>tokenize.cpp</tt> and
<tt>evaluate.cpp</tt>.
<p>
A <tt>makefile</tt> is also provided so that the make utility
can be used to compile this program.  The first tutorial class 
will have presented the make utility, and how it relates to
Visual Studio projects.
<p>
<h4>ALGORITHM HINT</h4>
The comments currently in <tt>evaluate.cpp</tt> describe a sum expression
as the sum or difference of one or more product expressions. 
All of the following qualify:
<pre>
	2 * 3		// one product expression
	2 * 3 + 4 * 5	// two product expressions
	2 + 3 - 4 + 5	// four product expressions (just no *)
</pre>
A similar definition is given for product expressions, involving
one or more operands to multiply or divide.
<p>
A function parsing a sum expression can certainly assume
there is at least one product expression (and use a function
to understand that).  Then it just looks to see what comes next --
whether there is a + or - operator.  If there is, then accept
the second product expression, and then check for another + or -.
<p>
The possibility of parentheses is what leads to recursion in this
problem -- one may be multiplying the results of sums.
Parentheses maybe be nested arbitrarily deeply, but should
not be so deep as to exhaust the stack memory for function recursion.
<p>
<h4>EXTRA CREDIT OPTION</h4>
The subtraction operator is often also used as a prefix operator
negating the value that immediately follows it.  Any expression
could begin with that symbol, including a parenthesized expression.
For example, the expression <tt>- (-6)</tt> would evaluate to 6.
<p>
Allow such expressions in your program.  You may assume that
these extra minus signs may only begin in the beginning.
The string <tt>5 * -3</tt> would not be a legal expression,
but <tt>5 * (-3)</tt> would be acceptable.
