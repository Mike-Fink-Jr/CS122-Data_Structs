<h3>CMPSC 122<br>

<h3>Homework VI<br>
14 November 2014</h3>
</center>

Building off the previous assignment, this defines additional
derived classes to expand the expressions accepted by
the program.  In addition, it introduces the use of
the existing Standard Template Library to assist design.
<p>
<h4>PROBLEM DESCRIPTION</h4>
<p>
The previous assignment was able to support a wide variety
of integer expressions, including all the defined operations
for arithmetic and also the conditional expression for making
decisions.
No expression grammar would really be complete without being
able to call functions.  
<p>
To define a function using the actual syntax of the C language
would require a significant extension to the grammar,
including semicolons, braces, and variable declarations.
So instead, this assignment will take a shortcut and define
functions in this way:
<pre>
	deffn sqr(x) = x*x
	deffn abs(x) = x > 0 ? x : -x
	deffn gcf(a,b) = (rem = a%b) == 0 ? b : gcf(b,rem)
</pre>
The first token in the declaration will always be the string 'deffn'
(which will look like an token for an undeclared variable),
followed by a function declaration, and '=', and an expression.
You may assume the entire definition will appear on one input line.
Of course, the input may also include all the expressions from
the previous assignments.
<p>
You may assume for this assignment that all functions will be
defined before any expressions try to use them, and that
there will be no calls to non-existent functions.
<p>
<h4>FUNCTION DEFINITIONS</h4>
<p>
There are actually two aspects to handling functions --
there is the definition of the function and its code,
which would appear only once in a program.  And then
there are the function calls, which may occur many times,
with different actual parameters.
<p>
For uniformity, part of the definition part has already been declared
in a newly provided file.  It would record the function name,
the name of its formal parameters and all local variables,
and a link to the code body for that function.
<p>
Of course, since a program can consist of multiple functions,
there would need to be a container to hold these definitions.
For this assignment, we will take the easy way out and let
the Standard Template Library take care of this for us.
And since we always choose a function by name (and not by
the order in which it was declared), the <tt>map</tt> template
would be best to use.
<p>
A header has been provided to declare this object.   The STL
will take care of its implementation.  All that is
required is for your program to use it.  It will create this
definition map whenever a line begins with "deffn", and then it
will refer to it whenever a function is called.
<p>
A typical compiler might use a single data structure to hold
all declarations (variables, functions, constants, etc.) but
we will minimize our work by keeping variables and functions
separate.  In fact, this will actually simpifly many things,
since function names in C++ are inherently global, and
variable names are ideally local.  (And for these programs,
all variables will be local).
<p>
You will therefore see that there is an additional parameter
defined for evaluating expressions -- a reference to all the
functions available for use.  Most operations (such as +)
really do not need this function list, but they will need to
pass it to anything that does.   You will need to actually
implement all parts of the code that will deal with
recognizing a function call, representing it as a tree node,
and then evaluating it later.
<p>
<h4>COMPONENT FILES</h4>
<p>
<table border>
<tr><td colspan=2>New to this assignment:
<tr><td><tt>funmap.h</tt><td>Defines a data structure for function definitions.
<br>DO NOT CHANGE
<tr><td colspan=2>Replaced for this assignment:
<tr><td><tt>evaluate.h</tt><td>Defines additional parameter to <tt>evaluate</tt>
<tr><td><tt>driver.cpp</tt><td>Defines and calls a few sample functions
<tr><td colspan=2>To modify and adapt from earlier assignments:
<tr><td><tt>token.h</tt><td>May or may not support a comma separating parameters
<tr><td><tt>token.cpp</tt><td>May or may not support a comma
<tr><td><tt>tokenlist.h</tt><td>May or may not recognize a comma
<tr><td><tt>tokenlist.cpp</tt><td>May or may not recognize a comma
<tr><td><tt>exprtree.h</tt><td>Add support for function call
<tr><td><tt>exprtree.cpp</tt><td>Add support for function definition and call
<tr><td><tt>evaluate.cpp</tt><td>Add support for function definition and call
</table>
Once again, the grader will not be using the same <tt>driver.cpp</tt> file,
so you are free to edit that as much as desired to test your code.
<p>
Most of the files above will be included with your submission,
with the exception of <tt>evaluate.h</tt> and <tt>driver.cpp</tt>.
Any input that was valid for Homework II will still be valid now.
<p>
A <tt>makefile</tt> is also provided so that the make utility
can be used to compile this program.  The first tutorial class 
will have presented the make utility, and how it relates to
Visual Studio projects.
<p>
<h4>NO EXTRA CREDIT OPTION</h4>
<p>
The final assignment will have several extensions for Extra Credit,
so if you want to or need to get credit, take an early look at that!
