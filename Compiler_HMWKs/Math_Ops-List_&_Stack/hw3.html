<h3>Homework III<br>
3 October 2014</h3>
</center>

This assignment continues with the use of a simple linked list,
including an iterator to traverse that list. It also includes
the implementation and use of a stack.
<p>
<h4>PROBLEM DESCRIPTION</h4>
<p>
What people find to be a natural way of writing an arithmetic expression
is not so natural to a machine implementation.  Even for something as
simple as <tt>2 + 2</tt>, we recognize that the addition operator applies
to the value that follows it.  In scanning the expression from left to right,
we implicitly remember the plus, until we know what it would be adding.
<p>
In a computer program, we certainly have a natural way of remembering
a value, those are stored in memory.  But remembering an operation
(which may involve several machine instructions) is not so natural.
With that in mind, some machine designers would prefer to have the
operands precede the operation, such as <tt>2 2 +</tt>.  Once the
plus symbol is seen, the values to add have already been encountered.
<p>
Consider this expression (simplified from the earlier assignments):
<pre><font size=+1>
	9 - 6 * ( 2 + 8 / 4 ) 
</font></pre>
Rewriting this with the operators last, and with parentheses
included for clarity, this would become
<pre><font size=+1>
	9 ( 6 ( 2 ( 8 4 / ) + ) * ) -
</font></pre>
Now the subtracting is clearly postponed until its operands
have been determined.
<p>
Usually, expressions like this are written without parentheses.
Every operator applies to the values that immediately precede it,
where those values are either given, or computed by other operators:
<pre><font size=+1>
	9 6 2 8 4 / + * -
</font></pre>
Postfix expressions therefore have no need for parentheses, which
simplifies their grammar, as well as the machine implementation.
It is actually used by Hewlett Packard calculators, and also by
the Java Virtual Machine (a hidden simulation within a Java implementation).
<p>
Unfortunately, it is unlikely that most of the population at large
will adopt postfix notation for general use, so most programs will
still accept the more well-known infix form.
<p>
This assignment consists of two major steps:
<ul>
<li> Convert an infix expression into a postfix expression.
<br>
Both expressions will be represented as a linked list of Tokens,
as were defined in the previous homework.
<li> Evaluate a postfix expression that computes an integer value.
</ul>
<p>
Between these two steps, display the contents of both linked lists.
<p>
NOTE: Just as the preceding assignment, this solution must
permit the possibility of using the result of a previous calculation.
<p>
<h4>ALGORITHM HINTS</h4>
Both of the major steps above could be understood recursively,
but they also both have well-known iterative algorithms.
One iterative algorithm will be required for this assignment;
the other will be optional.
<p>
Required Loop Implementation:<br>
Each operator in a postfix expression applies to operands that precede it.   
A recursive implementation to evaluate a postfix expression 
would have found those operands recursively.
An iterative approach would instead expect to find its two
values stored in a data structure, and then stores its results
in that same data structure.   It will always be retrieving
the most operands that have been determined, so one needs a
data structure that supports that.   All it needs to do is scan
a postfix expression and perform operations as it sees them.
<p>
Optional Loop Implementation:<br>
It should be evident that in translating an expression from infix to postfix,
the order of the operands is preserved (such as the values 9, 6, 2, 8, 4).
The operators are postponed until later, with lower precedence
operations (accounting for parentheses) occurring after higher
precedence operations.  A stack would be an excellent place to
store these operators until the proper time.
<p>
When two operators of equal precedence have been encountered
(accounting for parentheses), the first one encountered is no
longer postpone -- it is supposed to occur before the second.
It would be removed from the stack to the output, and then
replaced by the new arrival.
<p>
Regarding the Optionality:<br>
If this were the last or only assignment involving arithmetic expressions,
this loop implementation would likely not be optional -- it is
a very standard method that is worth knowing.  But for the later
assignments, the recursive parsing method would actually be much
simpler, so it would save a lot of student programming time to
keep the same algorithm here as was used since the first assignment.
<p>
<h4>INTRODUCTION TO ITERATORS</h4>
<p>
Practicing good information hiding means that a client using
a container (such as a linked list) should have no knowledge
of the exact implementation (such as next pointers).  Of course,
it is good for it to know enough about the container to know that
it is appropriate to the application, but isolating the implementation
greatly reduces the chances of programming errors.
<p>
The <tt>TokenList</tt> class in the previous assignment included
some methods to assist in traversing the linked list, so that
the application could visit the list elements in turn.  Unfortunately,
building that into the list class itself introduces a possibly
burdensome limitation -- only one traversal may be performed at a time.
<p>
Therefore it is preferable to have a distinct variable outside
of the <tt>TokenList</tt> class to support traversal, so that
several traversals could be performed concurrently.  The only
new 'free' code for this assignment defines a new class that
would allow sequential access to the <tt>TokenList</tt> object.
Since it actually follows the next pointers within the class,
it will need to be given access by being declared as a friend.
So, inside the <tt>TokenList</tt> object itself, include a declaration:
<tt>friend class ListIterator;</tt>
<p>
<h4>COMPONENT FILES</h4>

A very different version of this file will be used for grading.
</table>
<p>
The files to be submitted for this assignment are <tt>tokenlist.h,
tokenlist.cpp</tt> and
<tt>evaluate.cpp</tt>.
If you defined and used precedence for tokens, include
<tt>token.h</tt> and/or <tt>token.cpp</tt> as well.
<p>
A <tt>makefile</tt> is also provided so that the make utility
can be used to compile this program.  The first tutorial class 
will have presented the make utility, and how it relates to
Visual Studio projects.
<p>
<h4>EXTRA CREDIT OPTION</h4>
<p>
Consider the following expression:
<pre>
    4 * ( - ( - 4 - 3 ) )
</pre>
An 'easy' way to address the negation operator is to imagine
it is subtracting from 0, yielding this postfix expression:
<pre>
    4 0 0 4 - 3 - - *
</pre>
<p>
Implement a clean and simple solution to this negation operator
that does not require pushing extra zeros onto the stack.
Be sure to mention that you have done so in the Message Box
when submitting, so the grader will know to test your code.
<p>
Since the specifications above require displaying both linked lists,
the grader should be see how you went about addressing this problem.
