// Simple Expression Evaluation Implementation file
// This describes the functionality for evaluating very simple
// arithmetic expressions.  Given a string consisting of operators
// and operands, it will evaluate that expression and return its value.
//
// The expressions may consist of the following:
// -- single-digit integer values
// -- simple arithmetic operators ( +, -, *, /, % )
// -- matched parentheses for grouping

// This implementation consists of a set of mutually-recursive 
// functions. which will track the structure of the expression.
//
// A sum expression is the sum or difference of one or more products.
// A product expression is the product or quotient of one or more factors.
// A factor may be a number or a parenthesized sum expression.
