<h3>Homework II<br>
19 September 2014</h3>
</center>

This assignment introduces the definition of classes, and their
use in the implementation and use of a simple linked list.
Since the list itself consists of a variety of tokens, those
have also been defined as a class that addresses that variety.
<p>
<h4>PROBLEM DESCRIPTION</h4>
<p>
The first assignment was a simple program to evaluate expressions like this one:
<pre><font size=+1>
	9 - 6 * ( 2 + 8 / 4 ) - 1 + 3 * 7 % 5`
</font></pre>
Many people when faced with expressions like this have become
accustomed to using calculators to make such computations.
And, of course, calculators are very much like very small computers,
so how the calculator would solve the problem would be very much
like the first assignment.
<p>
But there are some limitations with the first program that
should be lifted if our program is to really be a good simulation.
The limitations to remove in this second assignment are these:
<ul>
<li>
Values appearing in an expression are not limited to single-digit numbers.
To only allow a user to type one digit at a time would make many
computations extremely cumbersome.
<p>
<li>
Not only do calculators perform a single computation, but
they facilitate a series of computations, remembering the results
of a previous calculation to be used in the next.  This removes
the need for the user to have to re-enter the calculated result.
<p>
For example, this series of inputs:
<pre>
	2 + 3
	- 1
	* (17 - 13)
</pre>
would yield results of 5, 4, and 16.
</ul>
<p>
NOTE to those who did Extra Credit in Homework 1:  The second result above is not negative 1!
<p>
<h4>ABSTRACT DATA TYPE -- TOKEN</h4>
<p>
The first assignment got away with representing every token in the
expression as a single character, where that character was either
a numeric digit or an operator.  That quickly proves to be impractical
when many integers consist of more than one digit, as do several
real operators.
<p>
Therefore, a good program must be able to support tokens of more
than one character.  One obvious treatment would be to make every
token be a character string (or array), but since arithmetic is
defined for integers and not character arrays, that also can prove
to be cumbersome.
<p>
Instead, we will use objects to represent more abstract data types --
in this case, a Token can be any element in an expression, (such
as integer or operator).  If the Token is an integer, its value will
be easily accessible; and if it is an operator, that too will be
easily identified.
<p>
A Token class has been defined for this assignment to support 
this flexibility.   It will be expanded upon on later assignments.
<p>
<h4>ABSTRACT DATA TYPE -- TOKEN LIST</h4>
<p>
Since this application considers an expression to be a series of tokens,
the idea of a list is certainly appropriate.  There is a definite
order to the tokens (left to right), and it simply examines them
as they appear.
<p>
The first assignment got by with treating the expression as
a character array, since all tokens were single characters,
with some number of unused single-character blanks interspersed.
But now that tokens may have multiple characters, the character
array is no longer appropriate.  An array of tokens would be
conceivable, but without further details on the input, there is
no real information on how big that array should be.
<p>
A dynamically allocated linked list, on the other hand, can
use just as much memory as is required, so can adequately
handle inputs of any reasonable length.  It is also simple
to prepend a token onto the front of this linked list to 
handle the second bullet point in the Problem Description above.
<p>
<font size=-2>
(One could conceivably prepend the character array input
with the integer value of a preceding expression, but to do
so in constant (O(<em>1</em>)) time would require some special application-specific
handling.  You can try to figure out how that would work, but
that would not be suitable for this assignment.)
</font>
<p>
This program will basically consist of two phases for each input:
first the input will be converted into a linked list of Tokens,
which will represent the <em>complete</em> expression (which may
require the result of the preceding computation); and then
evaluate the expression using that linked list.
<p>
<h4>COMPONENT FILES</h4>
Header files (.h) will now begin to declare classes and their methods,
and source files (.cpp) will implement many of those methods.
<p>
There may be some methods within the header file if they
are very brief.  These are primarily simple accessor methods
(such as betting the integer value of a Token), but I sometimes
will expand them to functions that are very very short.
<p>
A function that is implemented within a class definition in C++
becomes an <tt>in-line</tt> function, meaning that when the compiler
encounters a function call, it simply expands the function code
in place.  This does yield code duplication in the executable file
(so should not be done for large functions) -- but it avoids the
need to call and return, which would dominate the execution time
of a simple accessor method.
<p>
<table border>
<tr><td><tt>token.h</tt><td>Declares tokens<br>DO NOT CHANGE (yet)
<tr><td><tt>token.cpp</tt><td>Understands tokens<br>DO NOT CHANGE (yet)
<br>
Unless supporting the Extra Credit option
<tr><td><tt>tokenlist.h</tt><td>Declares token list s<br>

<tr><td><tt>evaluate.h</tt><td>Declares <tt>evaluate</tt> function<br>DO NOT CHANGE
<tr><td><tt>evaluate.cpp</tt><td>Evaluates a tokenized expression</tt><br>
The algorithm will be essentially unchanged, but now it will
obtain Tokens from a linked list instead of characters from an array.
This will still consist of mutually recursive functions using the
linked list (which must be constructed before any evaluation occurs).
<br>Complete and submit

A very different version of this file will be used for grading.
</table>
<p>
The files to be submitted for this assignment are <tt>tokenlist.h,
tokenlist.cpp</tt> and
<tt>evaluate.cpp</tt>.
<p>
A <tt>makefile</tt> is also provided so that the make utility
can be used to compile this program.  The first tutorial class 
will have presented the make utility, and how it relates to
Visual Studio projects.
<p>
<h4>EXTRA CREDIT OPTION</h4>
Large numbers with very many digits can sometimes be very hard to read,
so we generally group the digits into groups of three.  Write some
<em>simple</em> code into the <tt>Token</tt> object.
to display large integer results in this manner --
specifically for numbers of greater than FIVE (5) digits.
<p>
For example, the value <tt>40320</tt> would show up just the way it is,
but <tt>3628800</tt> would appear as 3,628,800
<p>
You may test this code by having your <tt>driver.cpp</tt>
construct a Token with any integer (including one returned 
from <tt>evaluate</tt>).  This function is to be activated
via the <tt>&lt;&lt;</tt> operator, and not called directly.
Your <tt>driver.cpp</tt> would need to <tt>#include "token.h"</tt>
to know what a Token is to do so.
<p>
Part of the evaluation for this option will be the simplicity and
clarity of the code.  Multiple nested loops or huge decision structures
would therefore not score well, even if they happened to succeed.
