<h3>Homework VII<br>
8 December 2014</h3>
</center>

This assignment includes another excellent application
for inheritance, where one parent class has several
derived classes, at least one of which may have derived
classes of its own.  Also, it provides another opportunity
to make use of the Standard Template Library.
<p>
<h4>PROBLEM DESCRIPTION</h4>
<p>
The previous two assignments provided a very good picture
how how expressions are structured, and how they can be
evaluated, but they do not at all represent how a real
program would tend to evaluate them.   Although a compiler
may build a tree structure to understand and optimize code,
it would not try to store that data structure in a file
to be interpreted at run time.
<p>
Instead, it would produce a series of instructions understood
by the machine -- what is often referred to 'object code'.
This assignment will mimic that translation into a machine language,
and then simulate execution of that code.   No knowledge of
any particular machine language or assembly language will be
required for this assignment.
<p>
<h4>THE SIMULATED MACHINE</h4>
<p>
Instructions occupy memory; data occupies memory; so naturally
our simulated machine will consist of memory.  This will be easily
represented by arrays.  The instruction memory array will hold
instructions (a new abstract data type); the data memory array
will simply be an array of integers, since all of our expressions
deal with integers only.
<p>
In addition, most modern machines have a distinct set of storage
locations directly within the Central Processing Unit, called "registers".
All instructions involving calculations will use the registers.
There are separate instructions that would transfer values
back and forth between these registers and the data memory.
<p>
For simplicity, and since many real compilers do this, we will
first assume an arbitrarily large number of registers are available,
and just pick a new one any time one is needed.   Of course, a real
machine really has a finite set of registers, but that issue is
handled as a later step, and therefore not important to this assignment.
<p>
The instructions in many modern machines are very simple --
just doing one operation.  It might be easiest to jump to an example.
<p>
<h4>SAMPLE CODE TRANSLATION AND EXECUTION</h4>
Here is a small 'program' to use an example input to the assignment:
<pre>
a = 3
b = a+2
(b+1)*(b+1)
</pre>
And jumping to the end, here are the results of 'running' this code.
<pre>
3
5
36
</pre>
In fact, Homework 5 should have been able to do this already.
<p>
But different from Homework 5 is what happens in between: producing
and executing some sort of machine code.   Here is what my solution produces:
<pre>
 0: T1 = 3
 1: stack[0] = T1
 2: print T1
 3: T2 = stack[0]
 4: T3 = 2
 5: T4 = (T2+T3)
 6: stack[1] = T4
 7: print T4
 8: T5 = stack[1]
 9: T6 = 1
10: T7 = (T5+T6)
11: T8 = stack[1]
12: T9 = 1
13: T10 = (T8+T9)
14: T11 = (T7*T10)
15: print T11
</pre>
The exact appearance of your intermediate code is not important,
and this is not precisely how the instructions are represented in 
my data.   The code to display my compiled instructions just
displays them in a format that is easier to read.
<p>
This example uses 11 registers (T1 through T11), two variables
(sorted in positions 0 and 1 on the stack), and 16 instructions.
Of these instructions, 4 place a constant into a register, 3
load a variable into it, 2 store into a variable, and 4 compute.
Those are representative of what real machines do.
<p>
Real machines, however, do not actually have a 'print' instruction.
That is a convenience for this assignment.  It may be noted that
there is no equivalent in the input file either.  It will be understood
implicitly that the result of each expression is to be displayed.
<p>
Typical machines also have two very important special registers --
the program counter and the stack pointer.  The program counter
is nothing more than an indicator of what instruction to do next.
For the simple example above, all it did was count from 0 to 16.
The stack pointer assists in finding variables in the data memory,
and will be discussed more later in this assignment file.
<p>
<h4>REPRESENTING INSTRUCTIONS</h4>
The program is represented as an array of instructions, but
there several different kinds of instructions available.
Therefore, inheritance would be highly relevant in this problem.
<p>
There are very few methods required for any of these classes.
All that is needed is a way to construct an instruction,
a way to display it (much like <tt>toString</tt> for ExprTree),
and a way to execute it.  Furthermore, execution should be
very simple, since all the necessary information is encoded
in the instruction itself.  (I expect many one-line methods).
<p>
In addition, it should be noted that all of the computational
instructions look very similar.  To emphasize that, I just wrote
one output function that is used by all 4 of those above, by
defining an intermediate instruction type for all such computations.
The individual instructions simply define their own ways
of executing themselves.  An example declaration is provided as well.
<p>
<h4>THE NEWLY GIVEN MAIN FUNCTION</h4>
<p>
The given Driver program does the following:
<pre>
-- accepts the name of a "source code" file from the command line.
-- reads each source line in turn, and "compiles" it into machine code
-- displays all of the compiled code (such as those 16 instructions above)
-- initializes the program counter and stack pointer
-- runs the program until it gets to the end
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>compile</tt> function is very much the same as the
<tt>evaluate</tt> function in the previous assignments, renamed
to emphasize the no actual evaluate occurs.  Instead, the
the appropriate machine instructions are generated and stored
into the program memory.
<p>
Since it is expected that each derived class already has 
a straightforward way of performing each operation,
it should be straightforward to adapt them to generate
the required machine instructions, and in the proper sequence.
<p>
The interface to <tt>compile</tt> also includes some reference
parameters to be assigned where the program execute will begin and end.
Certainly in the example, it began at the beginning of the array,
but if there were any functions defined first, those would not
execute until they were called.
<p>
You will see that this driver program refers to the size
of the Variable Tree data structure -- that is, how many 
variables have been defined within it.  It might be more
obvious to just have it also start at zero, but this was
done to support function calls (see later). 
<p>
The given main program also automatically advances the program counter
for every instruction (like any machine would).  This avoids
the need to do it separately for each instruction type.
<p>
<h4>OPERATIONS TO SUPPORT</h4>
<p>
For full credit on this assignment, your program must
support all arithmetic operations, variables, and the
assignment operation to modify those variables.
The rest of the following will be worth varying amounts 
of Extra Credit.
<ul>
<li>The conditional expression
<br>
This would need to be able to jump over the code that is not to
be executed, which would require instructions to change the program counter.
Two new instructions would suffice -- one to change the program
counter if and only if the boolean expression is false; and one
to change it unconditionally (to get to the next expression).
In both cases, what to change it to will not be known until a bit later,
so these instructions will be backpatched when the required value is known.
<p>
Of course, this would also require support for the relational operators,
but that is not much different from arithmetic.
<p>
<li>Non-Recursive Function Definitions and Function Calls
<br>
This involves assigning values to the parameters, changing the program
counter to refer to the function, and then, after the function ends,
changing the program counter back to where it was.  Also, it will
making sure two active functions do not try to use the same memory.
<p>
Everyone should recall that when a 'real' program runs, memory
is set aside for each function's variables, and then returned
on function exit.  That can be managed by the given stack pointer
variable.  This value (which is just an array subscript here)
is subtracted by the memory needs of the function at the start,
and then restored by addition at the end.
<p>
That this is starting at the back of the memory array and subtracting
instead of starting and the front and adding is simply a matter of
practicality.  If we started at 0, then the value to add or subtract
would be the memory needs of the calling function, which are completely
unknown to the called function, which could be called from anywhere
at any time.  This subtraction approach allows us to compile with
known values.
<p>
To be able to return to the calling function at the end, one
must remember where to go back to.  And if there are further 
function calls, several such values would need to be remembered.
Fortunately, we already have this simulated stack memory, so
it would be wise to make use of it.
<p>
A lot of stuff clearly happens on function call and return.
You are welcome to define special Call and Return instructions
to do so, even if those instructions have a lot to do (such
as changing the stack pointer and program counter).
It might be simple in some cases to actually use the existing
register to/from memory instructions to assist you.
<p>
Full credit for this extra credit option must support
multiple arguments, and not necessarily exactly one.
<p>
<li>Recursive Functions</li>
To avoid infinite recursion, these functions would necessarily
use the conditional expression within the function body.
Ideally that would mean this would follow naturally from
both of the preceding Extra Credit options.  
<p>
But since it is very possible to create an implementation
that does not support recursion (which was true for many
20th-century compilers), so this is just making sure
the two features work together properly.
</ul>
<p>
<h4>COMPONENT FILES</h4>
<p>   
<table border>
<tr><td colspan=2>New to this assignment:
<tr><td><tt>machine.h</tt><td>Defines the abstract data type for machine instruction
<br>
Complete by defining the necessary derived classes.
<tr><td><tt>machine.cpp</tt><td>Implements the display and execution of instructions.
<br>
Complete by implementing the necessary class methods.
<tr><td><tt>compile.h</tt><td>Defines the top-level interface in the program
<br>
This is substituting for evaluate.h, but has much of the same appearance.
<tr><td><tt>compile.cpp</tt><td>Build an expression tree, and then translate to machine code.
<br>
No starter file is given; over half of it is just the previous <tt>evaluate.cpp<tt>
<tr><td colspan=2>Replaced for this assignment:
<tr><td><tt>driver.cpp</tt><td>Now gets data from a file, then compiles and executes.
</table>
<p>
Several files will need to have additional code added to them.
The <tt>exprtree</tt> files will need to include the ability to
translate the tree into instructions.  The <tt>vartree</tt> and
<tt>funmap</tt> files will need to note that variables and
functions occupy positions in memory, and it would be useful
to know just how much space is required by those variables.
<p>
Since no new language elements are added in this phase, there
should be no changes required to <tt>token</tt> or <tt>tokenlist</tt>
<p>
<h4>ADDITIONAL EXTRA CREDIT: COMMON SUBEXPRESSIONS</h4>
<p>
A quick glance at the sample code above would indicate that
it is doing a bit more work than it needs to do.  It is
computing the value of "b+1" twice.   It seems it should
only need to compute that value once, and then reuse its value.
<p>
A good optimizing compiler would do its best to eliminate
such redundant work.   Here is a sketch of how it could do that.
<p>
First: Every time a variable is assigned to, remember where
it got its value from.  After all two "b+1"'s would not be equal
if the value of b could change between them.
<p>
In this case, the only assignment to variable b is the value of T4.
<p>
Once that is recorded, that fact can be used for all subsequent
uses of that variable, before it is changed again.  For this
sample program, we would not be calling for new registers 
in instructions 8 and 11, but would simply use T4 again.
<p>
Similarly, before defining a new register to hold a constant value
we can check to see if that value has already been encountered.
That would mean we would not have to store 1 into two of them.
<p>
That much would start generating code that looks like this:
<pre>
 0: T1 = 3
 1: stack[0] = T1
 2: print T1
 3: T2 = 2
 4: T3 = (T1+T2)
 5: stack[1] = T3
 6: print T3
 7: T4 = 1
 8: T5 = T3+T4
</pre>
We have now gotten as far as evaluating the first "b+1", and
now things get interesting.  When translating the second "b+1",
we see a need for b (already in T3) and a 1 (already in T4).
So computing "b+1" means adding T3 + T4, but we already did that too!
The second operand to the multiplication can just reuse T5,
and we will have eliminated three instructions all at once.
<p>
That is the optimization technique in a nutshell, but to be
truly good, it must be reasonably efficient.  It would not
be wise to scan through all the preceding instructions to look
for a match.  Doing so would make compilation time proportional
to the square of the size of the program!
<p>
Instead a good implementation must include a fast (e.g. O(<em>1</em>) time)
way of identifying that the sum T3+T4 was already computed
(even if it was not the very last operation).  The same approach
would also be helpful in spotting duplicated constant values.
<p>
NOTE: Do not get misled by the conditional expression.
If "b+1" was computed when a boolean test was true, it will
not be available to the code for when the boolean test is false,
and will not always be available after that expression is complete.
It would be therefore acceptable (and likely more correct)
to let some of that code stay the way it is.
