<h3>CMPSC 122<br>
Fall 2014</h3>

<h3>Homework IV<br>
17 October 2014</h3>
</center>

This assignment introduces the use of a tree structure
as a container, for rapid random access, associating
string names with other data.
<p>
<h4>PROBLEM DESCRIPTION</h4>
<p>
Very few arithmetic expressions in a program consist of constant
numbers as their only operands.  Most of them instead include
variables that have been assigned in earlier statements.
This assignment will therefore extend the earlier assignments
by introducing variables as operands, and the assignment
operator to assign to them.
<p>
The major part of this assignment may either build from 
Homework II or Homework III, at the student's choice.
However, it is recommended that it still make use of the
List Iterator class defined in Homework III.
<p>
<h4>THE ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR</h4>
<p>
Most people certainly recognize the assignment operator as one
that performs an assignment operation (giving a value to a variable).
But in the languages of C, Java, C++, etc. it also 'computes'
a value, which can be used in a larger expression.
<p>
For example, this expression:
<pre>
	A = 3 + (B = 2)
</pre>
Not only assigns 2 to B, but it adds that 2 to 3 to get a value of 5 for A.
<p>
Your program must accept this as a valid input.  And of course,
not all valid inputs will necessarily assign to variables, and
(from Homework II), some may even build on results of earlier statements.
For example, this would be a valid input line after the previous example:
<pre>
	* B
</pre>
yielding a value of 10.
<p>
<h4>COMPONENT FILES</h4>
<p>
<table border>
<tr><td colspan=2>New to this assignment:
<tr><td><tt>vartree.h</tt><td>Defines classes for a new abstract data type
<br>DO NOT CHANGE, unless pursuing Extra Credit
<tr><td><tt>vartree.cpp</tt><td>Implements the class, with help from recursion.
<br>Complete and submit
<tr><td colspan=2>Replacements for this assignment:
<tr><td><tt>evaluate.h</tt><td>
Adds a new parameter to the <tt>evaluate</tt> function.
<br>DO NOT CHANGE
<tr><td><tt>driver.cpp</tt><td>Rewritten to use new <tt>evaluate</tt> interface.
<tr><td colspan=2>To modify and adapt from earlier assignments:
<tr><td><tt>token.h</tt><td>Variable names may be more than one letter, 
so will require strings.<br>It would be best to no longer store a single char,
<br>but you could still keep an accessor method that returns one.
<tr><td><tt>token.cpp</tt><td>May need to be extended to support variable names.
<tr><td><tt>tokenlist.h</tt><td>No change should be required
<tr><td><tt>tokenlist.cpp</tt><td>Must be able to scan for variable names and assignment operator.
<tr><td><tt>evaluate.cpp</tt><td>
Will now recognize variable names and the assignment operator.
<br>Complete and submit
</table>
Once again, the grader will not be using the same <tt>driver.cpp</tt> file,
so you are free to edit that as much as desired to test your code.
<p>
Most of the files above will be included with your submission,
with the exception of <tt>evaluate.h</tt> and <tt>driver.cpp</tt>.
Any input that was valid for Homework II will still be valid now.
<p>
A <tt>makefile</tt> is also provided so that the make utility
can be used to compile this program.  The first tutorial class 
will have presented the make utility, and how it relates to
Visual Studio projects.
<p>
<h4>EXTRA CREDIT OPTION</h4>
<p>
Write code so that one display all existing variables
(and their values) using
just one usage of the <tt>&lt;&lt;</tt> operator.   
For example, it should be legal and meaningful for the last
statement in the <tt>main</tt> function in <tt>driver.cpp</tt>
to be <tt>cout << vars << endl;</tt>
<p>
Of course, the score for this option will depend on clarity
and simplicity of implementation.
