<h3>Homework V<br>
31 October 2014</h3>

This assignment will also use a tree structure, but
in this case, there will be several different varieties
of elements in that tree.  It will therefore also make
use of derived classes and polymorphism.
<p>
<h4>PROBLEM DESCRIPTION</h4>
<p>
An <em>expression tree</em> is a representation of an expression
that highlights how operands and operands relate to each other
with respect to order of operations.  For example, here is an
expression tree for the expression displayed in Homework I:
<pre>
   9 - 6 * ( 2 + 8 / 4 ) - 1 + 3 * 7 % 5

                      +
                   /     \
                  -       %
                 / \     / \
                -   1   *   5
               / \     / \
              9   *   3   7
                 / \ 
                6   +   
                   / \
                  2   /
                     / \
                    8   4
</pre>
A person seeing this as a picture can possibly more easily determine
which operations must precede which others.   Similarly, a compiler
can more easily understand an optimize this code if it has an internal
representation like this.
<p>
As an example of a possible optimization, consider the leftmost
portion of this expression.  Until this point, all methods of
evaluating the expression would need to hold the first values
(9, 6, 2, 8, 4) simultaneously in memory, using five memory locations
to do so.  On the other hand, a compiler could postpone placing
the 9 into memory it is done computing with the other four values.
In fact, we could even imagine taking advantage of commutativity
by 'rewriting' the tree to represent <tt>(8/4 + 2) * 6</tt>.
This would reduce the need to hold values that are not yet used
in a computation.
<p>
Such an optimization will not be part of this assignment
(Homework VII will revisit it).  For now, it will be enough
to build this tree and evaluate it.
<p>
This program is to accept every legal input from the earlier assignments,
including the use of variables.  In addition, it is to support the
Conditional Expression, which appears in C, C++, and Java.
<p>
<h4>CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS</h4>
<p>
This is an example expression that uses a conditional expression:
<pre>
	y = x > 0 ? x : -x
</pre>
A boolean (true/false) expression precedes the <tt><b>?</b></tt> symbol,
and a <tt><b>:</b></tt> separates expressions that would be evaluated
in case that boolean was true or false, respectively.   One could
rewrite this one using an <tt>if</tt> statement like this:
<pre>
	if (x > 0)
	    y = x;
	else
	    y = -x;
</pre>
The conditional expression can be used in several contexts where
the <tt>if</tt> statement cannot, such as the middle of other
expressions, or as arguments to functions, etc.  It also allows
our expression programs to evaluate many more interesting things.
<p>
The conditional expression unfortunately cannot be well represented
in a postfix grammar.  At first glance, it would seem straightforward
to have a postfix expression first evaluate the consequences
(e.g. <tt>x</tt> and <tt>-x</tt>) and then choose one afterwards,
but that would not always give correct results.  In fact, in Homework VI,
we will even see a common context for which such an approach would
be completely wrong.
<p>
Instead, this will also be represented in tree form, with a
boolean expression to evaluate, and then the appropriate subtree
would be evaluated after the boolean expression.
<p>
<h4>BOOLEAN VALUES IN OUR INTEGER EXPRESSIONS</h4>
<p>
For simplicity, all values in these homework assignments will
be assumed to be integers.  We will borrow the approach the C
language family, and just use integer values to stand for booleans.
0 will stand for false; any nonzero (usually 1) will stand for true.
You may either explicitly use 1 for true, or simply use
whatever value the underlying C++ language gives.
<p>
Support these six operators for making boolean tests:
<pre>
	>  <  >=  <=  == !=
</pre>
The <tt>&amp;&amp;</tt>, ||, </tt> and <tt>!</tt> will not be required,
since they would add more work that is useful for this assignment.
<p>
<h4>POLYLMORPHIC EXPRESSION TREE</h4>
<p>
Any legal expression can be an operand to an addition operation;
any legal expression can have its value compared to another;
any legal expression's value can be assigned to a variable.
So to have the program's data structure dictate the nature
of the operands would be highly inflexible or cumbersome.
<p>
Therefore, this is a situation where class inheritance is
especially helpful.  A generalized tree node will be part
of the expression tree, but then will be specialized for
each of the possible things that may be an expression:
<ul>
<li> a constant integer value
<li> a variable
<li> a computation (arithmetic or relational or assignment)
<li> a conditional expression
</ul>
The assignment operation can be treated as a separate case, if desired.
<p>
This program will build an expression tree using these
derived classes, and then evaluate afterwards.  Parsing
the input can use recursive functions very much like
those in Homework II.  
<p>
<h4>THE toString METHOD IN THIS ASSIGNMENT</h4>
<p>
It would always be nice to be able to use the <tt>&lt;&lt;</tt> operator
to display newly defined objects, even when there are derived classes.
Unfortunately, we cannot simply define friend operator functions for
each derived class, because the compiler would be producing code to call
functions at compile time.
<p>
It is possible to make the compiler postpone method binding
until run time if we use <tt>virtual</tt> methods -- where a
parent class indicates that the function call choice will be postponed.
However, we cannot do the same thing for functions that are not
declared within an object.
<p>
So instead, a <tt>toString</tt> method has been defined for these
objects, and then the friend operator function for output will
call that method.  Defining <tt>toString</tt> as virtual then lets
each derived class dictate how its output will appear.  This much
has already been partially provided for you.
<p>
Within the implementation for converting integer values to strings,
you will see an object type <tt>ostringstream</tt>, which is
treating a string as if it were receiving the output (instead
of a file or the screen).  This technique will be very useful
for those derived classes that are not yet implemented.
<p>
<h4>COMPONENT FILES</h4>
<p>
<table border>
<tr><td colspan=2>New to this assignment:
<tr><td><tt>exprtree.h</tt><td>Defines the classes for the expression tree.
<br>DO NOT CHANGE, unless doing Extra Credit
<tr><td><tt>exprtree.cpp</tt><td>Implements the class, with help from recursion.
<br>Two derived classes are provided; two are not.
<br>Complete and submit
<tr><td colspan=2>To modify and adapt from earlier assignments:
<tr><td><tt>token.h</tt><td>May or may not need changes to support new operators.
<tr><td><tt>token.cpp</tt><td>May or may not support new operators.
<tr><td><tt>tokenlist.h</tt><td>May or may not recognize new operators.
<tr><td><tt>tokenlist.cpp</tt><td>May or may not recognize new operators.
<tr><td><tt>evaluate.cpp</tt><td>
Will now convert a string into an expression tree and evaluate the tree.
<br>Complete and submit.
</table>
Once again, the grader will not be using the same <tt>driver.cpp</tt> file,
so you are free to edit that as much as desired to test your code.
<p>
Most of the files above will be included with your submission,
with the exception of <tt>evaluate.h</tt> and <tt>driver.cpp</tt>.
Any input that was valid for Homework II will still be valid now.
<p>
A <tt>makefile</tt> is also provided so that the make utility
can be used to compile this program.  The first tutorial class 
will have presented the make utility, and how it relates to
Visual Studio projects.
<p>
<h4>EXTRA CREDIT OPTION</h4>
<p>
One of the earliest languages in the field of Artificial Intelligence
was Lisp.  A version of that language is still in use in supporting
the Emacs editor (which is very much still in use).
<p>
A fundamental data structure in Lisp is the list (in fact, its name
comes from that fact).  In Lisp, all lists are space separated
items enclosed within parentheses:
<pre>
	( 3 4 5 )	( 1 2 (3 4) 5 )
</pre>
In fact, the all operations and functions in Lisp are also
lists, in which the first element is a function or operator:
<pre>
	( + 3 4 )	( abs x )
</pre>
Write code that will display your expression trees in Lisp form
immediately before evaluating.  A couple files have been provided
to help you work with this Extra Credit option:
<ul>
<li><tt>trylisp.sh</tt> takes a file of Lisp expressions and evaluates them.
<li><tt>add1</tt> is a sample file containing some sample Lisp expressions.
</ul>
<p>
It is expected that it will take considerably less time to implement
this feature into your assignment than to understand the relevant
portions of the Lisp language, especially if you make full use of
the inheritance features in the data.
