# Recur-Calc
CS122 recursive calculator compiler


Penn State Computer Science 122 - Spring 2015
Taken by: Michael Fink- Freshman Year

Each folder is a homework project for the class where we had to build a Calculators mathematical Compiler using various data structures
and finally building a Full Compiler as a bonus homework.

I did not complete the full compiler, and mean to do that at later date when I'm super bored, and have nothing better to do.

This class was a data structures course, and other than the given(but incomplete) header files, no prior teaching/knowledge of a compilers
meaning we had to figure out how a tokenizer, lexer, and parser works. But since we did not know they existed at the time(i have no clue why this was a freshman course) we couldn't look stuff up for information but instead the whole class brought sleeping bags and tents to the computer labs trying to figure out how to make the program work. Now That I am currently taking a Programming languages course I really want to bitch slap my professor, because we are doing more or less the same projects, just as juniors/seniors in College!
