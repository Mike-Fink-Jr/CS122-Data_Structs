<h3>The Double-Linked Lists</h3>
This is very similar to the Single-Linked List
presented in the previous class:
<pre>
        +---+---+---+  +---+---+---+  +---+---+---+  +---+---+---+
    X <---- | 5 | ---><--- | 7 | ---><--- | 3 | ---><--- | 4 | ----> X
        +---+---+---+  +---+---+---+  +---+---+---+  +---+---+---+
</pre>
<p>
Twice as many pointers in existence certainly means 
all the basic operations have twice as many pointers to update.
<p>
This integer linked list example is memory wasteful (67% overhead);
more data per list node would certainly be more memory efficient.
<p>
Benefits include:<br>
can traverse the list in either order <br>
it is actually easier to modify the list (e.g. remove a node)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(as will be seen in this week's tutorial)<br>
facilitates ordering the list in non-chronological order<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.g. a queue with multiple priority values

<h3>The Circular List</h3>
The previous diagram contained two NULL pointers:<br>
The tail Node has no successor; the head Node has no predecessor.
<p>
An operation that traverses the list would have to check for those
NULL pointers before following the pointer (else get a run-time error)
<p>
Instead, have the head Node follow the tail Node, 
and the Node precede the head Node.
<br>
No more NULL pointers in this picture!
<p>
But now need some other way to know when to stop repeating loop
(such as when you find yourself back where you you started)
<p>
One can start a loop anywhere in the list and still visit all elements
<p>
There is no special treatment for inserting or removing at the extreme ends of the list.
<p>
This data structure could help a program that simulate
common card games like Hearts, Old Maid, Uno
<p>
There are only two special cases to be aware of:
<br>
--- adding an element to an empty list<br>
--- removing the only element of a one-element list
<pre>

<h3>The Augmented Circular List</h3>
The instructor likes to eliminate these last two special cases
by defining an empty list to be a single Node with no content.
If a list does contain data, this special Node completes a circular list
by following the tail Node and preceding the head Node.
<p>
There is a memory price to pay (a completely empty Node, in addition to all the pointers), but in return: no NULL pointers and no special cases!
<pre>
class Node
{
    friend class AugList;
    private:
	int	value;		// value stored here
	Node   *next;		// what follows
	Node   *prev;		// what precedes
	Node( int v, Node *n, Node *p ) : value(v), next(n), prev(p) { }
};

class AugList
{
    private:
	Node *stub;		// the unused node
	int   size;
    public:
	Auglist()		// create an empty list
	{
	    stub = new Node(0, NULL, NULL);
	    stub->next = stub->prev = stub;
	    size = 0;		// no data yet
	}
    	~Auglist()
	{
	    while (stub->next != stub)
		remove(stub->next);
	    delete stub;
	}
	
	//  The following really should be four lines eadh instead of one
	//  with each brace ona line of its own.  They are simply condensed
	//  for purposes of the lecture slides.	
	bool    getSize();	{ return size;		     }
	bool	empty()		{ return size == 0;	     }
	int	first();	{ return stub->next->value;  }
	int	last();		{ return stub->prev->value;  }
	void	RemoveFirst();	{ stub->next->remove();	     }
	void    AddToEnd(int v) { stub->insertBefore( v );   }
	void    AddToFront(int v) { stub->next->insertBefore( v );   }
};

AugList::remove( Node *removal )
{
    removal->next->prev = removal->prev;	// connect the neighbors
    removal->prev->next = removal->next;
    size--;					// one less value
    delete removal;				// deallocate node
}

AugList::insertBefore( int v )
{
    Node *newNode = new Node( v, this, prev );	// followed by current node
    prev->next = newNode;			// follows old predecessor
    prev = newNode;				// and precedes this one
    size++;					// one more value
}

//  and just one illustrative list traversal
AugList::printReverse()
{
    for (Node *curr = prev; curr != stub; curr = curr->prev )
	cout << curr->value << " ";
    cout << endl;
}

</pre>
A loop that started at a specified node would stop on that same node.
