<h3>Intro to Iterators</h3>
<p>
Now that we know how to implement a list structure,<br>it would be good to make sure it is usable.
<p>
Here is a checklist from an earlier lecture:
<p>
A client should be able to:<br>
--- create a new (empty or initialized) linked list<br>
--- add values to a linked list<br>
--- remove values from a linked list<br>
--- examine a value stored in a linked list (such as the first)<br>
--- perhaps know how many values are in the linked list<br>
--- perhaps see all of the contents of the list, in order
<p>
Recall that all member variables (including pointers) are private.
<p>
Consider these possible combinations of the above operations:<br>
--- display all values that meet some condition (e.g. scores>90)<br>
--- remove all values that meet some condition<br>
--- edit or update a value (e.g. add 10 to a score)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(recall that the Node is immutable)
<p>
How might these problems be solved?<br>
How long would those solutions take -- O(<em>?</em>) 
<p>
All three can actually  be solved in a similar way in O(<em>n</em>) time.

<h3>The Iterator itself</h3>
It would be nice to have a mechanism that would enable traversing
a list, and allowing us to handle each list element in turn as desired.
<p>
An iterator is an object that allows a client to do that.
<p>
Close analogy: an subscript variable allows access to array elements in sequence.
<p>
Of course, the iterator would then have to know about next pointers, so would be declared to be a friend of the List class.
<p>
The client would also need to know how to begin and end a loop with an iterator.
These would be defined by the List itself.
<p>
First, to see how this would look to the client:
<pre>

   for (iterator = list.begin(); iterator != list.end(); iterator.advance() )
	// do something with iterator.value()

</pre>
For this classroom example, I will use the <tt>AugList</tt> from last class.
<pre>




</pre>
<h3>An Iterator for AugList</h3>
<pre>

class Iterator
{
    friend class AugList;	// the AugList knows what this is
    private:
	AugList	  *list;	// the list to traverse
	Node	  *current;	// current location in the list
	Iterator( AugList *l, Node *c ) : list(l), current(c) { }
    public:
	int& value() const	// reference to current value
	{
	    return current->value;
	}
	void advance()		// move on to the next
	{
	    current = current->next;
	}
};

// NOTE: private constructor, only created by AugList

// and inside Auglist are these new public methods

	iterator begin()	{ return iterator( this, next ); }
	iterator end()  	{ return iterator( this, stub ); }

// (Why does this last line use 'stub' instead of 'prev'?

	// insert new element and refer to it
	iterator insert( iterator pos, int v )
	{
	    insertBefore( pos.curr, v );
	    return iterator( this, pos.curr->prev );
	}

// Why does insert place the new value before the current instead of after?
// (Hint: consider the single-linked list case)

	// erase a particular element and refer to its successor
	iterator erase( iterator pos )
	{	
	    Node *next = pos.curr->next;
	    remove( pos.curr );
	    return iterator( this, next );
	}

<h3>Categories of Iterators</h3>
How much utility an iterator provides depends on the needs
of an application and the nature of the underlying data structure.
<p>
Forward -- traverses data in one direction only (begin to end)
<br>
Bi-Directional -- traverses in either direction (not for single-linked lists)
<br>
Random -- can also access in any order (not for linked lists)
<p>
Constant -- allows traversal of the data, but not modification
<p>
Input -- Forward and Constant
<br>
Output -- Forward and assumed Write-Only
<p>
For this course, the iterators for the homework assignments forward
iterators intended primarily as input iterators.
<p>
The upcoming tutorial has a forward iterator that allows changes to the list.
