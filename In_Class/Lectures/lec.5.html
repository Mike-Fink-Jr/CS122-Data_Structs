<h3>Intro to Linked Lists</h3>
<p>
Consider an application that acts as a server handling
multiple service requests and processing them in turn.
<p>
It is possible that several requests can arrive at the same time,
and would need to be stored until they can be processed.
<p>
Occasionally a high priority quest should be processed soon,
(but no sooner than existing high-priority requests).
<p>
Suppose we use an array with these invariants:
<pre>
N outstanding requests occupy positions 0 through N-1 in the array.
<br>
The next request to be processed is array element[0]
</pre>
<table border>
<tr><td>Add a new request to the end<td>O(<em>1</em>)
<tr><td>Remove the first request for processing<td>O(<em>n</em>)
<tr><td>Insert a high priority request<td>O(<em>n</em>)
</table>
<p>
As the number of unprocessed requests increases, so does the amount
of time maintaining this data structure.  Less time is spent actually
servicing the requests themselves, so the work piles up.
<p>
There is a better alternative using an array (we will see later),
but there is still another outstanding question:
<p>
What is the size of the array?   (If too small, information is lost.)
<pre>




</pre>
<h3>A closely related example</h3>
Everyone has stood in line at some point, usually expecting`
to receive service in order of arrival.
<p>
It is easy to know that you are first, second, or third in line,
but for long lines, it usually impossible to guess 'your subscript'.
Also, it is impossible to know how 'your subscript' changes
as time goes by.
<p>
Yet, there is no confusion about how a line operates, because
the subscript is unimportant; maintaining an array subscript is not productive.
<p>
It is sufficient to know where the line begins, where it ends,
and who is followed by whom.   A program data structure can do the next
with the help of pointers.
<p>
Here is an example of a linked list of integers:
<pre>
    +---+---+   +---+---+   +---+---+   +---+---+
    | 5 | ----> | 7 | ----> | 3 | ----> | 4 | ----> X
    +---+---+   +---+---+   +---+---+   +---+---+
      ^                                   ^
      +---- head                 tail ----+
</pre>
Each of these boxes indicates a variable that can be allocated
and deallocated individually of all others.  How would this behave?
<p>
<table border>
<tr><td>Add a new request to the end<td>O(<em>1</em>)
<tr><td>Remove the first request for processing<td>O(<em>1</em>)
<tr><td>Insert a high priority request<td>O(<em>1</em>)*
</table>
* assumes a small constant upper-limit on number of outstanding high-priority requests
<p>
<pre>





</pre>
<h3>A rough draft of the implementation</h3>
Each element in a linked list is a separate object, allocated
and deallocated independently of other objects.  Each contains
a pointer to its successor in addition to its data.
So, for an integer linked list:
<pre>
class Node 
{
    int	    value;		// value stored here
    Node   *next;		// pointer to successor
};

class List
{
    Node   *head,		// pointer to the first element
	   *tail;		// pointer to the last element
}

//  to add a new Node to the end of an existing list:
    tail->next = newNode;	// last element now has a successor
    tail = newNode;		// and that has become the last element

//  to remove the Node from the beginning of an existing list:
    head = head->next;		// the second item is now first

</pre>
The sample code is clearly O(<em>1</em>), not at all depending on the length of the list.
<pre>




</pre>
<h3>Memory Allocation and Deallocation</h3>
The lifetime of a value in the linked list is independent
of the function call behavior of a program, so must be managed
directly by the programmer.
<p>
It easy to identify when a Node should be allocated or deallocated:
<br>
at the time it is added or removed from the list.
<p>
These two list operations should be in charge of the allocation
and deallocation of Nodes, so that the client application
does not need to worry about pointer management.
<p>
When deleting a Node from a list, it is best to assure the
list has been placed in a stable state before deallocating the Node,
else you may be residing on data in deallocated memory!
<p>
To delete a complete linked list when it is no longer needed:
<br>
-- a loop traverses each node and deletes it<br>
-- a recursive function is called for each node and deletes it<br>
-- a destructor recursively deletes a successor Node<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be careful if you really only want to remove one thing!
<pre>




</pre>
<h3>Data Privacy and Information Hiding</h3>
A client should be able to:<br>
--- create a new (empty or initialized) linked list<br>
--- add values to a linked list<br>
--- remove values from a linked list<br>
--- examine a value stored in a linked list (such as the first)<br>
--- perhaps know how many values are in the linked list<br>
--- perhaps see all of the contents of the list, in order
<p>
A client must not be able to:<br>
--- make unrestricted changes to the data currently in the list<br>
--- change the pointers in the list<br>
--- reassign where the list begins or ends
<p>
Therefore, all data members for Node and List should be private,
and only the interface (constructors and methods) public.
<p>
But doing that introduces a little snag:
<br>
If all <tt>next</tt> pointers in a Node are private, how can a List update them?
<p>
A class may declare other classes or functions to be a <tt>friend</tt>,
granting the rights to manipulate its data to a select few.
<pre>




</pre>
<h3>Putting that much more together</h3>
<pre>
class Node 
{
    friend class List;		// a List is permitted to access these
    private:
	int     value;		// value stored here
	Node   *next;		// pointer to successor
	Node( int v, Node *n ) : value(v), next(n) { }
};

class List
{
    private:
	Node   *head,		// pointer to the first element
	       *tail;		// pointer to the last element
	int     size;		// number of elements
    public:
	List(int v)		// create a list with one element
	{
	    head = tail = new Node(v, NULL);
	    size = 1;		// one value so far
	}
        int getSize()		// may ask what the size is
	{
	    return size;
	}
	int firstValue()	// may ask what is at front
	{
	    return head->value;
	}
}

List::insertAtEnd( int value )
{
    Node *newNode = new Node( value, NULL );
    tail->next = newNode;	// last element now has a successor
    tail = newNode;		// and that has become the last element
    size++;			// one more item in the list
}

List::removeFromFront( )
{
    Note *removal = head;	// remember what is being removed
    head = head->next;		// the second item is now first
    delete removal;
}

List::~list()			// destructor method to deallocate list
{
    while (head != NULL)
	removeFromFront();	// might as well use existing code
}

<h3>Placement of Method Implementations</h3>
In the previous example, some methods were implemented
within the class definition and some were not.
<p>
This primarily affects how the compiler treats function calls to methods.
<p>
If the method implementation is within the class, the compiler
can see it, and expand the function in place in the code
(assigning to variables, and substituting references).
<p>
This saves the instruction time to copy parameters, call the function,
return from the function, and copy return values.
<p>
If the implementation is not within the class, that <em>inline</em>
expansion is not possible.  The only option is to call and return (as normal)
<p>
The apparent time savings comes at the cost of expanding the
code whenever it is called.  Large functions or frequently called
functions may actually incur a time penalty when the extra machine
code piles up.
<p>
So this inline expansion is best limited to very very short methods
<br>
( most constructors and destructors, and accessor methods )
<br>
that are highly unlikely to be changed or re-engineered.
<p>
Recursive functions cannot be inline.
<pre>




</pre>
<h3>Some other List Considerations</h3>
If a client only needs access to the front or back of a list,
a linked list implementation is O(<em>1</em>).
<p>
But access any other part of the array requires following pointers (O(<em>n</em>)).
<p>
<table>
<tr><td><td>Linked List<td>Sorted Array
<tr><td>Accessing the k'th element<td>O(<em>n</em>)<td>O(<em>1</em>)
<tr><td>Searching for a particular value<td>O(<em>n</em>)<td>O(<em>log n</em>)
<tr><td>Find maximum or minimum<td>O(<em>n</em>)<td>O(<em>1</em>)
</table>
But if you consider the original applications (server requests or a line),
these sorts of operations would not be required.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
Regarding memory use:<br>
There is no need to 'guess' how much memory is required (vs. the array)
<p>
But we do allocate more memory than we use for the data; pointers occupy space.
<p>
Only 50% of the integer linked list actually contains the integer data.
<p>
Practically, linked list nodes contain a lot more information.<br>
e.g. my class roster as a list with names, grades, emails, etc.
<br>
with only one 'next' pointer per student would be very memory efficient.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
Also Note: all linked lists have very similar behaviors,<br>
so code reuse suggests we should only have to implement the concept once.
<p>
C++ provides templates (which will be postponed until November);
<br>
C also has a useful mechanism (which will be postponed until December)
