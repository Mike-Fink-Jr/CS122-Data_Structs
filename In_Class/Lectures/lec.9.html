<h3>Intro to Inheritance</h3>
Suppose when developing a program, you discover there is an
existing class type that would be very helpful to you.
You would like to make use of it to reduce development time.
<p>
But sometimes there may be features or interfaces that do
not exactly match what you wish for your application,
and you would like to rewrite those methods, but you do
not have the ability or permission to rewrite the existing
class.
<p>
Inheritance is a mechanism that allows one to build a new
class out of an existing class, inheriting those features
one wishes to keep.
<p>
So, one will declare a <tt>derived class</tt> from a <tt>base class</tt>
to share in inherit existing features and also<br>
-- add new features (e.g. add element counting to a Stack that does not have it)<br>
-- define a new implementation (e.g. change how TimeOfDay displays current time)<br>
-- adapt it to a new application (e.g. use AugList to support a Stack or Queue)
<pre>

<h3>Extending a base class</h3>
Suppose <tt>SimpleStack</tt> has this public interface:
<pre>
class SimpleStack
{
    public:
	void push(int value);		// push a value onto the stack
	void pop();			// remove a value from the stack
	int  top();			// display the top value
	bool empty();			// is there anything still there?
};
</pre>
This contains all the necessary features of an integer stack,
but perhaps one wishes to know just how many values are currently stored.
Finding that out with this stack would require destroying and rebuilding it!
<p>
It would be nice to have a value simply count what is available,
so let us do so:
<pre>
class CountingStack : public SimpleStack	// keep all the public features
{
    private:
	int count;			// number of values
    public:
	CountingStack() : count(0) { }	// initially zero values
	void push(int value)
	{
	    SimpleStack::push(value);	// use existing code to push
	    count++;			// one more value
	}
	void pop(int value)
	{
	    SimpleStack::pop(value);	// use existing code to pop
	    count--;			// one fewer value
	}
	int getCount() const		// and be able to report value
	{
	    return count;
	}
};






</pre>
<h3><tt>protected</tt> members</tt></h3>
There is no information above regarding how <tt>SimpleStack</tt> actually works.
<p>
Even if we could see the source code for its implementation,
all of the <tt>private</tt> members are unavailable for use,
even for derived classes.
<p>
If the implementation happened to use an array (counting from element 0),
this new <tt>count</tt> variable would be redundant, but still necessary to support <tt>getCount()</tt>
<p>
A class designer can be 'friendly' to other coders by allowing some members of  a class to be visible to derived classes.
<p>
For example, the non-public part of <tt>SingleStack</tt> could be:
<pre>
	protected:
	    int data[STACK_SIZE];	// implemented as an array
	    int firstEmpty;		// first empty spot (where to push)
</pre>
So now <tt>getCount()</tt> is simply <tt>return firstEmpty;</tt>
<p>
Or, if the designer really wants to avoid the data from being accidentally corrupted:
<pre>
	private:
	    int data[STACK_SIZE];	// implemented as an array
	    int firstEmpty;		// first empty spot (where to push)
	protected:
	    int getFirstEmpty()		// you can look
	    [
		return firstEmpty;	// but don't touch
	    }
</pre>
<p>
In either case, an application declaring a stack cannot access these data members.
<pre>






</pre>
<h3>Restricting or Adapting a ase class</h3>
Perhaps the existing code not only includes features you wish
to use for your new application, but also many you do not wish to use.
<pre>
class CountingStack : private AugList	// hide the base class
{
    public:
	int getCount();		{ return AugList::getSize();	}
	int empty();		{ return AugList::empty();	}
	void push(int value);	{ AugList::AddToFront(value);	}
	void pop();		{ AugList::RemoveFirst();	}
	void top();		{ AugList::first();		}
};
</pre>
<p>
All of these are made inline so that the call can be made directly.
<p>
All of these chosen methods here are O(<em>1</em>).
<pre>








</pre>
<tt>Intro to Polymorphism</tt>
Suppose every person with a mailing address could be represented by <tt>class Person</tt> with a public method <tt>getMailingAddress()</tt>.
<p>
Most of the time, that would simply be the address where you live;<br>for some it might be a Post Office Box number.
<p>
Some people use multiple mailing addresses for different purposes, so this method would need to make a decision.
<p>
A derived class <tt>Faculty</tt> might direct University-related mail to a campus office, and other mail to a residence.
<p>
A derived class <tt>Entrepreneur</tt> might direct business mail to a PO box, and the rest home.
<p>
When requesting for someone's mailing address, the operation depends on the invidicual.
