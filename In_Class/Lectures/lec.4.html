<h3>Pointers</h3>
A <i>pointer</i> is a variable that contains the address<br>
of some other variable.
<p>
One special value <tt><b>NULL</b></tt> points at nothing,
and is often implemented as having a zero value.
<p>
A pointer variable itself may be changed (holding a different address)<br>
so that it will point at a different variable.
<p> 
Also, a pointer variable may be <i>dereferenced</i>,<br>
yielding a reference to the variable at which it points.
<p>
<pre>
// NOTE: This example is illustrative only, and not constructive!

int  j, k;		// two ordinary integers
int *intP;		// pointer to an integer
  
intP = &j;		// & is the address-of operator
*intP = 5;		// now j is 5
intP = &k;		// now intP points at k instead
*intP = 7;		// now k is 7
</pre>
<p>
Pointers may introduce aliasing!

<h3>Dynamic Memory Allocation</h3>
Pointers are more commonly used to access newly allocated variables.
<p>
<pre>
int  *intArray;			// pointer to integers
intArray = new int[20];		// allocate space for another 20 integers
class Employee *empP;		// pointer to an Employee class
empP = new Employee;		// allocate a new Employee instance
</pre>
<p>
Allocating an array <i>dynamically</i> (i.e. at run-time) is useful<br>
since the array size no longer has to be a constant at compile time.
<p>
Also Note: intArray and empP above are NOT aliases --<br>
the newly allocated item only has one name to access it.
<p>
The memory may (or must) be deallocated later:
<pre>
	delete[] intArray; 
	delete   empP;
</pre>
<br>

<h2>Pointers as Fast Array Access</h2>
The two following loops are functionally equivalent:
<table width=90%>
<tr><td valign=top>
<pre>
int  intArray[10];
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    cin >> intArray[i];
<td valign=top>
<pre>
int  intArray[10];
for (int *p = intArray; p < intArray+10; p++)
    cin >> *p;
</pre>
</table>
Since the pointer version does not have to recompute the addresses<br>
of array elements, it ends up being slightly faster.<p>
The difference in speed is more noticeable for simpler operations<br>
(such as clearing arrays, or adding up their values)
<p>
BUT: A compiler may be smart enough to convert this itself!
<pre>






</pre>
<h3>Dereferenced Pointers are References</h3>
Therefore, a reference parameter can be approximated with a pointer:
<table width=90%>
<tr><td valign=top>
<pre>
void swap( int &a, int &b )
{
   int temp = a;
   a = b;
   b = temp;
}
<td valign=top>
<pre>
void swap( int *a, int *b )
{
   int temp = *a;
   *a = *b;
   *b = temp;
}
</table>
Note that to get the reference, the pointers must be dereferenced.

<h3>A catalog of common programming errors with pointers</h3>
Forgetting to dereference a pointer before use<pre>
   *intP = 5;	vs.	intP = 5;	// points at nonsense memory
</pre>
Forgetting to use the address-of operator to initialize a pointer<pre>
   intP = &x;	vs.	intP = x;	// points at nonsense memory
</pre>
Dereferencing a pointer that has not yet been initialized<pre>
   int *intP;	*intP = 5;		// 5 is stored where?
</pre>
Accidental aliasing after assigning pointers<br>
(especially since pointers can point at <i>anything!</i>)
<p>
Reassigning a pointer that points to a dynamic allocation,<br>
so that there is no way to deallocate that memory (memory leak)
<p>
Dereferencing a pointer that points at memory that's been deallocated:
<pre>
   int *p, *q = new int(5);		// q points at a 5
   p = q;				// p points at the 5
   delete q;				// memory deallocated
   *p = 10;				// but p still points at it!
					// (and q probably does also)
</pre>
(If the memory is reallocated, then p would be an alias to it!)

<h3>Character Arrays vs. C++ Strings</h3>
<p>
These both have very similar meaning with regard to an application --
several character lined up in a row, representing a single value.
<p>
Character arrays are just like any other array; allocated when
a declaring function begins, and deallocated when that function ends.
Array size and location is expected to be fixed from the start and unchanged.
<p>
C++ strings manage their own memory.  They may be reallocated and copied
to prevent changes from exceeding their bounds, paying a price in time
for safety.  And of course, they are deallocated when containing function ends.
<p>
Dynamically allocated class variables may include character data.
The member variables may be C++ strings, or arrays, or pointers!
Pointers take less space within the object, because they point
at character data outside the object.
<p>
Be wary of pointers inside objects!  They may be equal to
pointers inside other objects (aliasing).  If the pointer value
was originally a local variable somewhere, then these pointers
may point at deallocated memory.
<pre>





</pre>
<h3>Pointers and Destructors and Value Parameters</h3>
Just as a constructor is called whenever a new class object is created,
a destructor is called whenever it is deallocated.
<p>
Usually destructors are have nothing interesting to do, so none is written.
(The default destructor does nothing.)
<p>
But if an object contains the only pointer to dynamically allocated memory,
that memory may remain allocated after the object goes away (memory leak).
<p>
A good program should deallocate all unneeded memory while it can
(unless it has a good expectation that the program will end 'soon')
<p>
Deallocating a 'large' data structure could either be done entirely
within that class's destructor, or it might be delegated to destructor
methods defined for each component allocation.
<p>
C++ has a surprise for those conscientious programmers who write destructors:
<br>
value parameters are copies of actual parameters, deallocated at function exit
<p>
How to avoid:<br>
(1) pass these objects by reference, or <br>
(2) pass pointers to these objects 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(not recommended unless you need that actual pointer)

<h3>Summary about Pointers</h3>
Their primary use is for dynamic memory allocation --
<br>
-- allocating arrays at run-time based on the needs of a program
<br>
-- heavily used in linked lists, binary trees, etc. (coming soon)
<p>
Secondarily used for easy access to arrays (pointer arithmetic)<br>
but compiler advances reduce the need for that.
<p>
Thirdly, can approximate reference parameters, but in C++
we should use reference parameters whenever possible.
<p>
Besides the above, there is very little advantage to pointers.
<br>
but plenty of disadvantages -- the principal one being aliasing.
<p>
In other words, don't use them without a good reason!
