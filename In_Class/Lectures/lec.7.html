<h3>Abstract Data Types</h3>
It can often be simpler to think about an application 
if one does not have to worry about the language details of its implementation.
<p>
With good modularity and information hiding, one can manipulate
an object without knowing anything about how it is truly represented.
<p>
Examples from this course and some others I have taught:<br>
clock time, deck of cards, container (bag or box), automobile
<p>
Even the idea of a Container of data is an abstraction --<br>
it could be an array or a linked list, which have different implementations.
<p>
Our first abstract data types for Containers are closely related to lists.

<h3>The Stack</h3>
Analogous to s stack of plates at a buffet restaurant.
New elements are always placed on top of the stack in O(<em>1</em>) time.
<br>
Existing data is always retrieved from the top of the stack in O(<em>1</em>) time.
<p>
This is often called a LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) data structure.
<p>
This is a simple data structure for storing information temporarily
and retrieving it later, especially if chronological order is
not required.
<p>
It can be implemented very easily as a single-linked list with only a <tt>head</tt> pointer.
<p>
BUT, a Stack is not necessarily a linked list.<br>
Everyone in this course should have already implemented it with an array.
<p>
An array implementation needs no pointers (uses less memory),<br>
but brings up the question on what the array size should be.
<p>
The Standard Template Library for C++ defines a Vector type
that behaves like an array which can reallocate and grow if data
is added to the end, so can support an efficient stack.
<p>
The <em>system stack</em> used for local function variables also is
not allocated as a linked-list data structure, but occupies a continuous region of memory.
<p>

<h3>The Queue</h3>
This is the word used in Great Britain for when referring to standing in a line.
<p>
New data elements are always stored at the back of the line in O(<em>1</em>) time.
<br>
Elements are only removed from the front of the line in O(<em>1</em>) time.
<p>
This is often called a FIFO (First-In, First-Out) data structure.
<p>
This data structure can also be easily implemented as a single-linked list, as is done for the Homework.
<p>
The queue can also be implemented as an array, but not using the last week's definition.
<br>
(first element == array[0]) ---> (insertion is O(<em>n</em>))
<p>
So remove that definition and record head and tail subscripts:
<pre>
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      |   |   | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |   |   |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
         head --^               ^-- tail
</pre>
<p>
Having the <tt>tail</tt> subscript refer just past the end of the data<br>
-- makes the insert/remove operations very similar (increment last)<br>
-- simplifies the computation determining number of elements
<p>
Of course, this approach will very rapidly reach the end of the array!
<pre>











</pre>
<h3>The Circular Array</h3>
Similar in concept to the circular linked list -- the first element follows the last.
<pre>
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      | 9 |   |   | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     tail --^       ^-- head
</pre>
All appropriate operations are O(<em>1</em>), and this requires less memory and time than a list.
<p>
If this array overflows, it can also be reallocated:
<pre>
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      | 9 |10 |11 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      |   |   |   | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |10 |11 |   |   |   |   |   |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
</pre>
Copying the data requires O(<em>n</em>) time, but only occurs after at least O(<em>n</em>) insertions (and probably many more)
<p>
The long-term cost averages out to O(<em>1</em>), so insert is still considered O(<em>1</em>).
<pre>







</pre>
<h3>The Double-Ended Queue</h3>
This allows insertion and removal at both ends of the data (and nowhere else),
so includes all the features of both stacks and queues.
<p>
Sometimes the name is simply shortened to <tt>deque</tt>.
<p>
This also can be implemented using a circular array with all supported operations O(<em>1</em>)
<p>
The Standard Template Library has a much more complicated variation:
<pre>

    +---+
    | ----> X     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    +---+     /-> |   |   |11 |12 |13 |14 |15 |16 |
     + ------/    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    +---+         +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    + ----------> |17 |18 |19 |20 |21 |22 |23 |24 |
    +---+         +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    + -------\    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    +---+     \-> |25 |26 |27 |   |   |   |   |   |
    | ----> X     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    +---+
</pre>
This represents a circular array of pointers, each pointing at
a dynamically allocated of a fixed size (8 in this example).
<p>
To find the 19th element: 19 &divide 8 = 2 R 3; element #3 of array #2
<p>
If the circular array overflows, it can be reallocated, but
all that needs to be copied are pointers, and not the actual data (much less time)
<p>
The Standard Template Library also defines subscripting for this
Abstract Data Type so that deque[0] == 11, deque[1] = 12, etc.
<br>
This subscript operation is also O(<em>1</em>), which would not be true for a list.
<p>
Inserting or removing anywhere other than the endpoints is O(<em>n</em>) and messy!
<pre>







</pre>
<h3>Wrapping up these Abstract Data Types</h3>
The stack, queue, and deque can be grouped together under the category
of <tt>sequences</tt>.
<p>
Each has the idea of a <tt>sequential order</tt> -- there is such
a thing as a first and last, or beginning and end.
<p>
The order in which the data appears is important.<br>
The position where the data appears is unimportant (and changes as time passes)
<p>
Key operations are inserting and removing values from the data structure,
where the choice of removal is based on when it was inserted.
<p>
The implementation may use either linked lists or arrays
<p>
Arrays do not require space for pointers and may take less time to execute,
<br>
but require the ability to accurately predict the array size.
<p>
Linked lists can adapt to the memory needs while the program is running,
<br>
at the cost of recording and maintaining pointers.
<p>
The Homework uses the linked list approach so it can work with any length expression.
