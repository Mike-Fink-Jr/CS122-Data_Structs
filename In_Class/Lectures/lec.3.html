<h3>Programming with Classes</h3>
A <i>class</i> is a <i>data structure</i>, holding multiple values.
<p>
An <i>array</i> is also a data structure, holding multiple values.
<p>
In an array, all values must be of the same type,
and are accessed using a subscript (usually an integer)
<p>
In a class, values may be of different type,
and are all accessed by individual names.
<p>
Each name specifies an <i>instance variable</i>.
<p>
<pre>
class Complex {
   double   real, imag;
};
Complex  c1, c2;
</pre>
<tt>real</tt> and <tt>imag</tt> are instance variables.
<p>
<tt>c1</tt> and <tt>c2</tt> are <i>instances</i> of this class.<br>
(Try thinking of all the variables in the past as instances of integers, etc.)
<p>
<tt>c1.real = c2.imag;</tt>
<pre>




</pre>
<h3>Initializing an instance of a class</h3>
It is certainly straightforward to initialize each instance variable:
<pre>
c1.real = 3;	c2.real = 4;
c1.imag = 2;	c2.imag = -1;
</pre>
<p>
But when a class has many instance variables, this may be tedious.
<p>
Most classes define <tt>constructors</tt>, which are initialization functions.
<pre>
class Complex {
   double  real, imag;
   Complex( double r, double i )
      : real(r), imag(i) { }
};
<p> 
Complex c1(3,2), c2(4,-1);
</pre>
<p>
Note: all instance variables are visible to any function defined
within that class, but they are not global variables.
<p>
Functions defined within a class are called <i>methods</i>.
<pre>




</pre>
<h3>More about methods</h3>
Methods are functions that are defined within a class
to manipulate the instance variables.
<p>
Since there may be more than one instance of any class,<br>
the name of an instance is also used in calling a method.
<p>
<pre>
Complex Complex::conjugate()
{
   imag = -imag;
   return *this;	// 'this' refers to the current object
}
  
double Complex::magnitude()
{
   return sqrt( real*real + imag*imag );
}
  
c2 = c1.conjugate();
cout << c2.magnitude();
</pre>
The syntax with the '::' indicates that these are member functions
of the class Complex, and would be used if the functions are implemented
outside the declaration of the class itself.  (More later)
<pre>




</pre>
<h3>Accessor Methods</h3>
Consider the following class definition:
<pre>
class TimeOfDay {
   int hour, minute, second;
   TimeOfDay( h, m, s ): hour(h), minute(m), second(s) { }
}  clock;
</pre>
These would be a legal statements:<pre>
clock.minute = 70;
clock.second = -40;
</pre>
These would rather ruin the intuition of what time it is!
<pre>
To maintain control over the value of instance variables, many classes
hide them from the 'outside' world, be declaring them to be <i>private</i>.
</pre>
Access to the instance variables is limited to <i>accessor methods</i>:
<pre>
class TimeOfDay {
    private:
       int  hour, minute, second;   // not accessible directly
    public:
       TimeOfDay( h, m, s )   { setTime( h, m, s ); }
       void setTime( h, m, s) { setHour(h); setMin(m);  setSec(s); }
       void setMin( m )
       {
    	    if (m >= 0 && m < 60)   minute = m;
       }
       int getMin()		  { return minute; }
};





</pre>
<h3>Towards Information Hiding</h3>
Once a client is disallowed from changing instance variables directly,<br>
there is no need for that client to know the details of how those<br>
instance variables are actually implemented.
<p>
A class implementer is free to change the implementation of a class<br>
as much as he likes, if he preserves the interface visible to the outside.
<p>
<pre>
class TimeOfDay {
private:
   int secondsSinceMidnight;	// ranges from 0 to 24*60*60-1
public:
   int getHour()	{  return secondsSinceMidnight / 60 / 60; }
   int getMinute()	{  return secondsSinceMidnight / 60 % 60; }
   int getSecond()	{  return secondsSinceMidnight % 60;      }
   void setHour(h)
   {
	if (h >= 0 && h < 24)
	   secondsSinceMidnight = h*60*60 + secondsSinceMidnight % (60*60);
   }
   void advanceTime( int deltaSeconds )
   {
	secondsSinceMidnight += deltaSeconds;
	secondsSinceMidnight %= (60*60*24);
   }
};




</pre>
<h3>More Towards Information Hiding</h3>
Of course, the details of an implementation are not very well hidden<br>
if the code is in plain view in the same file as the client code.
<p>
Often classes are implemented in separate program files<br>
(which especially facilitates reusing classes for new projects)
<p>
The program files are then compiled independently and linked together.<br>
Separate compilation has been around a lot longer than classes have been.
<p>
Of course, these separate program files must still agree on their<br>
interfaces -- class definitions, methods, etc.
<p>
That information is stored in a common <i>header</i> file to be shared.<br>
User-defined header files traditionally have an extension ".h"
<p>
Ideally, maximal information hiding would mean only the public<br>
parts of a class would be stored in the header file<br>
-- the interface to the constructor, accessor methods, public methods<br>
-- NOT the implementation of any method, or the private instance variables.
<p>
Practically, C++ does not reach this ideal extreme
<pre>






</pre>
<h3>A couple steps Back from Pure Information Hiding</h3>
I) A class definition needs to have the private instance variables<br>
in order to know how much memory to allocate for an instance.
<p> 
e.g. the two implementations for TimeOfDay needed different allocations
<p>
II) Methods defined within a class declaration are <i>inline</i>;<br>
methods defined outside of a class declaration are not.
<p>
Typical constructors and accessors are very brief,<br>
and do not merit the machinery of function call/return.
<p>
Minimizing the implementation details in the header file<br>
maximizes flexibility in refining/improving the implementation.
<pre>





</pre>
<h3>A little word about <tt>const</tt></h3>
This is a good keyword to use whenever applicable!<br>
It gives information to whoever may read the program<br>
and also allows a compiler to do some optimizations.
<pre>
global constants 		-- should already be familiar<br>

constant reference parameters	-- already used for array parameters
				-- good for passing class 'values'

constant member functions (the word appears After the parameter list)
				-- does not modify the containing object

e.g.  double Complex::magnitude() const;





</pre>
<h3>Regarding global variables</h3>
Global variables are strongly discouraged because they open up
many loopholes for program bugs.
<p>
Class member variables are intended to allow the possibility of
sharing data among the methods for that class.
<p>
Do not allow these to behave like global variables!
<p>
In particular, avoid:
<ul>
<li>
Global objects with public data members
<br>
e.g. do not permit every function to assign <tt>clock.minute = 70;</tt>
<p>
<li>
Global objects with liberal modifier methods
<br>
e.g. <tt>setMinute(int arg) { minute = arg; }</tt> allows <tt>setMinute(70))</tt>
</ul>
<p>
More simply, and for maximal safety:<br>
no global variables; no public data members; minimal modifier methods
<p>
For large projects, one can allow for global objects with private data.
<br>
I would consider that if the object in question was:
<ul>
<li>
truly used by much of the program (usage appears in many functions)
<li>
unique (those functions do not intend to manipulate other objects of same type)
<li>
independent (its internal consistency is unrelated to other program behavior)
</ul>
<tt>cin</tt> and <tt>cout</tt> qualify.<br>
