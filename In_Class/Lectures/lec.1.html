<h3>The Role of Lectures and Texts in this Course</h3>
<p>
The recommended text for this course is Koffman & Wolfgang, "Objects, Abstraction, Data Structures, and Design Using C++"
<br>
The lectures for this course do not simply teach the textbook.
<p>
Both of these present information, but they do not replace each other.
<p>
Lectures <i>supplement</i> a textbook:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;additional illustrations and/or opinions are given<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clarifications are available interactively
<p>
A text <i>supplements</i> the lectures:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resource available while doing homework<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;additional practice exercises 
<p>
Probably the biggest difference is that I attempt to postpone
as long as possible OOP features that are in C++ but not Java,
which is in our next course.   
<p>
For best results, skim a chapter before it appears in lecture.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attend knowing what it is you wish to learn.
<p>
Be prepared to ask questions, or request clarification.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not answer any question that is NEVER asked.
<p>
Every student should understand most of the lecture at the end of class.

<h3>The role of Daily Practice Questions</h3>
These are provided to keep you current with the course material.
<p>
Computer programming, as a skill, can only be improved with practice.
<p>
Each set should be solvable on the date associated with it.
<br>
If you cannot answer them, get help BEFORE your grade suffers!
<p>`
Answers that are submitted in a timely manner will receive feedback accordingly.
<p>
Solutions will not be provided -- instead, questions may reappear on tests.
<p>
These are not scored, but your grade WILL strongly depend on participation!

<h3>The Role of Homeworks</h3>
There is plenty of time available for each assignment.  Use it wisely.
<p>
Every hour of thoughtful design can save two hours of coding and many hours of debugging.
<p>
Elsewhere, I estimated three hours per week is sufficient for the homework.
<br>
That assumes good use of your time, e.g. not writing code you later delete.
<p>
All homework assignments are posted and build on earlier assignments.
The sooner you complete one, the more time you have for the next.
<p>
I may have solutions posted, but they will be at least one week behind the schedule.  Planning to build on them will automatically leave you running behind.

<h3>The Role of Recitation Sessions</h3>
<p>
These are opportunities for learning new things, not informal answer sessions.
<p>
These are intended to exercise and develop fluency in course topics.
<p>
Almost of the initial program design will be complete;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will provide very little practice in program design
<p>
All recitations are to be completed within the designated class time;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i.e. be prepared!
<p>
The first tutorial is especially important.
<br>
If not adequately started, all other tutorials and homeworks will be affected!
<p>
The lectures, recitations, homework, etc. might not provide enough practice for everyone.

<h3>The Role of Exams</h3>
These intend to measure what you actually have actually learned, vs.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what you can download off the Internet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what you can memorize from old exams<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whether you can copy off of someone else undetected
<p>
If you give me enough reason to believe you cannot do things yourself,<br>
I will give you back a grade that says so.
<p>
What should you know for the test?  Almost Everything!
<p>
Except:<br>
-- precise values (largest representable integer, ASCII codes)
<br>
-- language elements outside the course (complete STL interfaces)
<br>
-- topics specifically postponed to later courses (e.g. most of OOP)
<p>
Midterms -- anything from lectures or completed assignments
<br>
Final ----- anything you should know before taking CMPSC 221 or 311
<p>
Learn the material as the course progresses; not just for exams.
<p>
The more you cram for this course, the less prepared you will be for the next!
